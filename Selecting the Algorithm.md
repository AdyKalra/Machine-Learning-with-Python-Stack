# Role of Algorithm
- Training data -> Algorithm-> Mathematical Model 

# Narrowing the selection 
- Compare factors
- decision factors
- Learning type they support
- Result type the algo predicts
- complexity
- basic or enhanced

# Learning Type
- Prediction Model => Supervised Learning

# Result Type
- Regression = Continuous values 
- Classification = Discrete values 
e.g Binary classification of true or false

# Complexity
- Simple
- eliminate algos that are ensemble algos
--  special algo that are multiple algos in one
-- used for tuning algos perf 
-- complex

# Basic v/s enhanced

# Candidate algos for Classification 
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree

# Naive Bayes
- Based on likelihood and probability 
- Every feature has the same weight

# Logistic Regression 
- Binary result 
- Relationship between each feature and then adds a weight

# Decision Tree
- Binary tree
- Node contains decision 
- requires enough data to determine nodes and splits

# Selected algo
- Naive Bayes
- simple
- fast 100x faster
- stable to data changes
