# Training 
- Letting specific data teach a Machine Learning algorithm to create a specific prediction model
- Why retrain ? New data = better predictions 

# Split Data
- Training data 
-- 70%
- Test Data
-- 30%

# Train Model 
- Using algos

# Python Training tips
- Dont rewrite frm scratch
- scikitlearn 

# Scikitlearn library 
- designed to work with numpy scipy and pandas
- data splitting 
- preProcessing
- feature selection
- model training
- model tuning 

# Jupyter to split and train 
- 70% for training and 30% for testing
- from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split
- verify predicted value was split accurately 
-- original true abd original false same in test / training data

# Post split data separation 
- hidden missing value
- drop observations (rows)
- replace values (Impute)

# Impute with mean
- from sklearn.preprocessing import Imputer

# Training Initial algo - Naive bayes
