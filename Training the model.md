# Training 
- Letting specific data teach a Machine Learning algorithm to create a specific prediction model
- Why retrain ? New data = better predictions 

# Split Data
- Training data 
-- 70%
- Test Data
-- 30%

# Train Model 
- Using algos

# Python Training tips
- Dont rewrite frm scratch
- scikitlearn 

# Scikitlearn library 
- designed to work with numpy scipy and pandas
- data splitting 
- preProcessing
- feature selection
- model training
- model tuning 

# Jupyter to split and train 
- 70% for training and 30% for testing
