# Machine Learning Workflow 
- An orchestrated and repeatable pattern which systematically transforms 
and processes information to create prediction solutions

## Steps
- Asking the right question 
- Preparing Data
- Selecting the algorithm
- Training the model
- Testing the model

# Asking the right question 
- Define Scope (including data sources)
- Define target performance 
- Define Context for usage 
- Define how the solution will be created
